since we added ranks now to each node in the AVL tree
each node in the AVL has info about sumGrades
so when we add a Node to a tree
we naturally have to go up the search path and add the new employee grade to the sumGrades of all parents,
but, since AVLTree doesnt know what an employee is, and simply has data about key, value
we have to manually add an argument to insertNode which has the new (grade) data to add to the Sum of all parents

we could solve this by maybe:
1. adding an argument to insert node, delete node as mentioned above
2. keep insertnode without updating the search path, in each file we use insertNode we create and replace it with a function 
that both calls insertnode and calls a function that updates the search path 
3.. 


need to add de'tor to UF
